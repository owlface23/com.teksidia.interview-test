# Interview Coding Test

This is a simple C# coding test I wrote to give candidates.

It involves solving a sequence of simple problems to produce a "string calculator".

The problems are presented as unit test stubs, and the candidate must make them all "go green" in the allotted time.

Suggested time to complete: 20 minutes.
