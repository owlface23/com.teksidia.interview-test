# Interview Coding Test

This is a simple coding test I wrote to give candidates.

It involves solving a sequence of simple problems to produce a "string calculator".

The problems are presented as unit test stubs, and the candidates must make them all "go green" in the allotted time.

The test is not too demanding but should help weed out any inappropriate candidates who can talk a good game but not write proper code.

Suggested time to complete: 20 minutes.
